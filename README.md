# Conways game of life
This is a recreation of John Conway's Game of Life. More information can be found on the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

# Rules
* Any alive cell with less than two other alive neighbors will die, as if by underpopulation.
* Any alive cell with more than three other alive neighbors will die, as if by overpopulation.
* Any alive cell with two or three other alive neighbors will stay alive.
* Any dead cell with exactly three alive neighbors will become alive, as if by reproduction.

# How to open and use
1. Find conways-game-of-life.py and run it.
2. (I suggest to put the popup window in fullscreen because some of the cells get cut off.)
3. Use the arrow keys to move the grey square around the board of cells.
4. Press "z" to toggle the starting conditions for each cell. (White is alive and black is dead.)
5. Press "Space" to run the simulation -it will go on forever- to restart it close and reopen the program.
